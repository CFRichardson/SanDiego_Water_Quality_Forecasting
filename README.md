# Objective
The goal of this particular study is to predict the status of kelp beds within a designated area and forecast if water quality parameters stay within EPA standards. The  approach taken is to apply the ARIMAâ€™s residuals to a back-propagation neural network model to tackle seasonality, heteroskedasticity, and non-Gaussian error that can occur in our data. By applying this model to the stated  dataset, the predictions should represent an accurate forecast pattern for the targeted parameters.


## Methods Utilized
  * ARIMA
  * ARIMA Neural Network
  * Differencing
